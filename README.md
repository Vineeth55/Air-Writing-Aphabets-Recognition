# Air-Writing-Aphabets-Recognition

This repository contains the implementaion for Training and Testing a CNN classifier to identify the Alphabet
for the corresponding "Air Writing Signal". _stft_cnn.py contains the implementation where the input to CNN 
is given by converting the given signal into Time-Frequency domain using Short-Time Fourier Transform and similarly 
_stockwell_cnn.py contains implementation using Stockwell Transform.
